Strategy pattern can be categorized as it's simple and powerful. It can be considered in a kind of scenario where your object would perform a common action and that's a choice of different options.

Let’s understand the widely accepted definition of strategy pattern which you can find from various resources on net. “Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one of them and makes them interchangeable.” Confused with the definition? let’s try to break it in three parts:-

1) Family of Algorithms- The definition says that the pattern defines the family of algorithms- it means we have functionality (in these algorithms) which will do the same common thing for our object, but in different ways.

2) Encapsulate each one of them- The pattern would force you to place your algorithms in different classes (encapsulate them). Doing so would help us in selecting the appropriate algorithm for our object.

3) Make them interchangeable- The beauty with strategy pattern is we can select at run time which algorithm we should apply to our object and can replace them with one another
